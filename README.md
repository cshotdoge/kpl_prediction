# KPL E-Sports Tournament Ranking Predictor

This Python program simulates and predicts the ranking outcomes for teams in a KPL (King Pro League) e-sports tournament group stage. By taking into account known match results and running simulations for unplayed matches, the program calculates the probabilities of each team finishing in 1st to 6th place within the group.

## Key Features

- **Input Customization**: Users can input known match results or leave matches undecided, allowing for flexible simulation.
- **Simulations**: The program runs a large number of simulations to predict the ranking probabilities based on both known and randomized match outcomes.
- **Team Customization**: The program offers the option to use predefined KPL team names or customize teams for the group stage.
- **Tie-breaking Logic**: In case of ties, the program applies additional logic to determine rankings fairly.

## Usage

1. **Run the Program**: Execute the script to start the ranking prediction.
2. **Select Mode**: Choose between using predefined team names or inputting custom team names.
3. **Input Results**: Enter known match results or leave the results blank if not yet available.
4. **View Probabilities**: After the simulation, the program will display the probability of each team finishing in each rank from 1st to 6th.

This tool is particularly useful for analyzing potential outcomes in ongoing or upcoming group stages in KPL tournaments, helping fans and analysts estimate the chances of their favorite teams advancing based on current results.
